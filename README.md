# deepwebdetector
Programme to verify if you are in deep web (1.0) Prototype

# V 1.0 - 9.28.18 - Manwhore Industries, SA
# Simplest bash file to double check the nodes between yours and the site you are visiting
# TODO: Geolocation, and site reputation ranking etc.
# Important: This is being initially programmed in git bash and intended to be used with tracert
# You may run this program in Linux by changing it to traceroute
# Official tracert utility is a missing feature in Windows 10 onwards
# Download tracert for windows from https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/whois

DeepWeb - An alternative Internet.  As of 9.28.18 the problem has grown out of proportion with estimates up to 96% of the content in tne Internet.

This tool will attempt to detect nodes that could be adding, subtracting or transforming information, injecting data or stealing it.  It will not be a sophisticate tool, rather, it will strive for simplicity by using off the shelf tools such as cmd or bash and a basic whois client.

Although TOR and other darkwebs are unsearchable by Google, it is my belief that like other technologies such as deep fake, the cost to build a darkweb has drastically reduced in recent years/months.  Romantic scenarios of a super sophisticated network of ultra high tech hackers turn then into average people with access to the backbone.  If only one node is supplanted, then it can connect to an entire deep web, effectively becoming an unknown darkweb, almost impossible to track by other means than verifying the routes from the originating node and verifying each node one by one.

This is traffic detour, phishing, and may receive other names but ultimately is darkweb.  The nodes might be actually a virus in a router that detours the traffic to other sites.  This is particularly easy to achieve since most backbone infrastructure has been sold as literally scrap by former operators absorbed by bigger operators or new operators.  Some of these nodes might have the minuteman password syndrome, whereby their passwords are the same as of the manufacturing and utilising insecure protocols.

Recent events such as Brexit, fake news, the elections in the U.S. and Mexico make this vulnerability particulary suceptible for ilegitimate usage.  A variety of possible scenarios is possible, i.e. delivering results to google maps from a fake location or altering biasing results.

Contrary to common belief, the most profitable use of darkweb is control, not illicit or illegal activities which can be carried out without the need of the Internet.  From controlling public opinion, giving fake directions to an election ballot, to altering the route of your Waze or Google Maps.
